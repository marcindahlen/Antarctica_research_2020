In the late 80' prof. dr hab. Terelak had been going to [Arctowski research station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Arctowski_Polish_Antarctic_Station) to gather data about scientists' social interactions. Now, in the advent of long-term manned space missions it is especially valuable to analyze the data and learn from it.

In [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/marcindahlen/Antarctica_research_2020/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) I performed some basic summary statistics about the data I received.

I've transformed the data from information about points coordinates marked on charts to distances. This unfortunately has caused the loss of the plausible patterns people used to mark their opinions. With the distances organized by people by sessions, I've looked at how those changed through time, I've created sample graphs of parallel (and mutual) relations and used the graphs to get closeness centralities. Finally, I've plotted a graph defined by mean closeness centralities across all sessions, and peeked into possible groups of people. Done all this, I've tried to come with some insights from what I learned.
